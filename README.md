# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the user experience (UX) of two AI-based conversational platforms—ChatGPT and Perplexity—using Jakob Nielsen’s heuristic principles. The objective is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare competing platforms, and recommend improvements that enhance usability, efficiency, and user satisfaction.

## Algorithm:
# Step 1: Selection of Apps
Choose the competing applications for evaluation:

ChatGPT

Perplexity
# Step 2: Define Framework
Use Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the evaluation criteria.

# Step 3: Data Collection
Perform hands-on testing of each application. Execute common tasks such as:

Asking questions and follow-up queries

Generating explanations and summaries

Verifying sources (where available)

Editing and regenerating responses

Copying and exporting content

Record observations for each heuristic.

# Step 4: Heuristic Evaluation

Evaluate each application against the 10 heuristics. Note usability strengths, weaknesses, and heuristic violations.

# Step 5: Comparative Analysis

Create a comparison table to analyze how each application performs. Highlight the best performer for each heuristic.

Step 6: Problem Identification

List recurring usability issues. Prioritize critical problems affecting user experience.

# Step 7: Recommendations

Suggest actionable design or feature improvements for each application. Align recommendations with UX best practices.

# Step 8: Conclusion

Summarize the overall evaluation. Identify which application delivers the strongest UX and provide improvement paths for others.

## Output:
# Heuristic Evaluation of Music Streaming Apps: Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music
# Introduction
This report presents a heuristic evaluation of two AI-powered conversational tools: ChatGPT and Perplexity. The evaluation is based on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, focusing on user experience (UX), interface clarity, system feedback, and information reliability. The goal is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses and suggest improvements for enhanced user satisfaction.

# Evaluation Framework
We used Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the framework:

Visibility of system status
Match between system and real world
User control and freedom
Consistency and standards
Error prevention
Recognition rather than recall
Flexibility and efficiency of use
Aesthetic and minimalist design
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Help and documentation

# KEY FINDINGS

ChatGPT: Best overall UX with conversational flow, flexibility, and user control.

Perplexity: Strong for factual search and source-based answers but limited creative flexibility.

# Recommendations
# For ChatGPT
Improve long-conversation organization and provide better navigation between topics.
# For Perplexity
Add conversational memory and better follow-up interaction similar to chat-based systems.

# Conclusion

ChatGPT and Perplexity serve different user needs. ChatGPT excels in conversational interaction, creativity, and flexibility, while Perplexity performs well as a fact-focused AI search assistant with reliable citations. Combining conversational depth with stronger contextual memory can further enhance Perplexity’s UX.
